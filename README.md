# HAapp

Files within this repository are used to create a product finder app for my company for better communication of product options in the field for sales/marketing.  Data is hosted on an AWS server at www.hai-rcs.com.  
A sample of data is included in the accompanying CSV file. 

The app is developed with Shiny-R, requiring a server and ui file. Additional modifications are made with HTML/CSS.
